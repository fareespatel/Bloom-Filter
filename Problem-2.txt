# Problem 2

# According to the graph of 'k vs. FPR' attached along with the code, I intend to choose n/m = 4 i.e. n = 4 * m i.e. size of bit_array = 4 * size of set (due to memory constraints) and the value of k = 3 because it has the minimal probability of FP possible when n/m = 4 (orange line in the plot)

#============================Optimal value from Graph========================================

# for k = 3, n/m = 4, Prob(FP) = 0.14689159766 (from the above calculations)
